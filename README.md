# Play-Flash-Game-With-Ruffle-On-Your-Site
This is code to embed a Flash file (game) on your site, but uses Ruffle (Ruffle is a replacement for Flash Player).

Put the link to your flash file into the code where it says: "YourFlashFileLink" and them put it in your website, where you imbed a file or link, feel free to ask questions.

For example it's used on this site on this page for a game: https://sites.google.com/view/fancyexplore/shop/portal-player/fpaw1
